Track/Log the amount you saved through a telegram bot.

Usage:

Invite the bot to your telegram group (like inviting a friend) using this ID: @kumbaramanager. Then:
- Type /help to get these descriptions below of usage in the group you invited the bot.

- Type any positive number(integer or float) to save it up! 
- Type /mybalance to see your own contribution in the group.. 
- Type /overall to see everyone's contribution in the group..
- Type /lastfive to see last 5 contributions in the group.
- Type /flush to delete all savings in the group. (Warning: Irreversible!)

Anything typed non-number or non-listed commands does nothing, you may chat in that group as well.

Features:

- Typing any number(integer or float) aggregates in TL
- Total saved amount both by individual person and by group will be showed also in US dollar when /overall command called.
- If saved amount is spent you may flush the save history. 
- /overall command also shows everyone who contributed.
